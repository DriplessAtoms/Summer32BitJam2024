Tim:There you are.
Vance:Morning.
Tim:Hey, man, you doing okay?
Tim:I know today’s probably not one you want to spend working, but…
Vance:Don’t worry. I’m fine.
Tim:You sure? I know your folks ran this place before us.
Tim:Isn’t it hard for you to be here today?
Vance:It’s been 20 years, Tim. At some point, you just gotta let it go.
Tim:Your parents suddenly disappearing from your life without a word isn’t something I think you can just let go.
Vance:I admit I still want to find them, but there’s nothing I can do.
Vance:I’ve tried everything I could and after all this time I still have no idea where they went.
Tim:We could try looking for that weird signal you said you heard the day they vanished.
Vance:We’ve tried that a thousand times already.
Vance:Unless a miracle happens, I don’t think it’s ever coming back.
Vance:Can we just drop this and start the show?
Tim:Alright. Sorry for pushing so hard.
Vance:Thanks.
Tim:Hey, how about we go out for drinks after this?
Vance:Now you’re speaking my language. You’re paying.
Tim:We’ll see.
Tim:Now, let’s get onto the air.
Radio:(Radio begins making strange sounds)
Tim:…Huh?
Vance:Why’s the radio making that sound? Are we getting some kind of interference?
Tim:I don’t know. Last I checked, everything was fine.
Vance:Wait… I know this signal. It’s the same one from back then!
Vance:Do you know where it’s coming from?!
Tim:The waves are all screwed up.
Tim:I can’t pinpoint a precise location, but there seems to be a similar weaker signal not too far from here.
Vance:I have to track down this signal. Can you hold down the fort while I check on the weaker signal?
Tim:You’ve got it. But you’d better hurry.
Tim:The signal isn’t stable so I don’t think it will stay around for long.
Vance:Then I guess I’d better move fast!
