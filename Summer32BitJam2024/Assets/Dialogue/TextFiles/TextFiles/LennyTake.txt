Vance:I’m back!
Lenny:Y-yeah, I know, you don’t have to yell so loud.
Lenny:This is exactly why I sent someone else to deliver the tab.
Vance:Hello?
Lenny:I’m sorry, I have to go. I’ve gotta talk to someone.
Lenny:I’m sorry for making you do my dirty work. Come on in.
Vance:Sounds like someone was angry.
Lenny:He was. I’ve been pretty late on paying back my tab, and Hank’s a demon when he gets angry.
Lenny:I’m just glad he didn’t snap at you.
Vance:Tell me about it. I don't think I’d survive.
