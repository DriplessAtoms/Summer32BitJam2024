Vance:Finally got it. Wait, that’s weird.
Vance:I think I can hear voices.
Radio:Sorry for *bzzt* you. *bzzt* can explain if *bzzt*.
Vance:That’s weird. Now it looks like it’s leading me to another signal.
Vance:Maybe if I track it down, I’ll be able to better hear whoever’s speaking.
Lenny:Leaving already?
Vance:Yep! I’ve gotta hurry before I lose the signal.
Lenny:Oh, alright. Well, good luck.
Vance:And good luck to you with Hank. Something tells me you’ll probably need it more than me.
Lenny:Oh… don’t remind me!
