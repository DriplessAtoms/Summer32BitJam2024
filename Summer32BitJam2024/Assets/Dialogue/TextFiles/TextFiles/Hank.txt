Vance:Delivery!
Hank:Huh? What’s all this racket?
Vance:Hank! Just the guy I’m looking for.
Hank:What’s this about a delivery?
Vance:Lenny asked me to give this to you.
Hank:This is from him?
Hank:Grah, that numbskull is going to get an earful for sending someone else to pay his tab for him.
Hank:Sorry he put you through this, and thanks.
Vance:No problem.
