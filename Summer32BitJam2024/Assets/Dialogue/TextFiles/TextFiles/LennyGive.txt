Vance:This seems to be where the signal is coming from.
Vance:Okay, here goes.
Vance:Hello! This is Vance from Vance and Tim’s radio show!
Stranger:Woah! I love your show! I can’t believe you’re really here!
Lenny:I’m Lenny.
Vance:I know this is sudden, but do you mind if I come in to look at your radio?
Vance:It’s really, really, really important!
Lenny:My radio? Why?
Vance:Long story! To keep it brief, I’ll just say it may help me find out what happened to my parents the day they disappeared.
Lenny:That’s… wow.
Vance:So, can you let me in?
Lenny:Well, since it’s so important to you, I’ll let you see it if you do me a favor.
Vance:What is it?
Lenny:Here. Take this letter and deliver it to Hank at Hank’s Bar.
Lenny:He’ll call me the moment he gets it so I’ll know if you did it or not.
Vance:I’ll get right on it!
