Olly:If it isn’t little Vance! What a nice surprise.
Vance:Hey, Olly. Do you mind if I come in and take a look at your radio?
Olly:What for?
Vance:It’s a long story. Just know that it’s really important, and I don’t have a lot of time.
Olly:Gotta move fast, huh?
Olly:That reminds me, how quick are you on that old hoverboard of yours?
Olly:Do you still got it like you did back when you were younger?
Vance:Well, I may have slowed down a little bit.
Olly:That’s no good. If you’re in a hurry, you need speed!
Olly:Tell you what, I’ll let you use my radio if you can beat your old time from here to Craggle Point.
Vance:But my time–
Olly:Will only get shorter if you keep yapping. Now get a move on!
