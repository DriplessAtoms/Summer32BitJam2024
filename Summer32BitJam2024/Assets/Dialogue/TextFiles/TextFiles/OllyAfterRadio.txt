Vance:That’s another signal matched. 
Vance:Let’s see what voices I can hear this time.
Radio:…need to hurry. Have to *bzzt* back home. We hope *bzzt* reaches you.
Vance:Sounds like the people speaking want this message to reach someone fast.
Vance:Weird. They sound so familiar, but it’s still not clear enough. 
Vance:I’d better track down the next signal to find the rest of it.
Olly:Getting back on the road?
Vance:Yeah. 
Olly:Heh! Still moving like a youngster. 
Olly:Always wish I had a board like the one your folks made for you.
Vance:Yeah. I still don’t know how they made it.
Vance:If only I got them to tell me before they vanished.
Olly:Well, you might not know how to make one, but you and that friend of yours run a darn good show. 
Olly:I’m sure that wherever your folks are, they’re proud of you for following in their footsteps.
Vance:Thanks, Olly. See you around.
