Vance:I hope this has the rest of the message.
Radio:We need to meet soon. There’s not much time left before we *bzzt* home. Come to the top of Hakko Peak. We’ll be waiting.
Vance:Those voices… Could it really be?
Vance:There’s only one way to find out. Thanks, Sheryl.
Sheryl:Go get ‘em, Vance!
Sheryl:Oh, and just so you know, I’m a huge fan of your radio show.
Sheryl:Maybe you’ll let me on there someday, huh?
Vance:I’ll be sure to save you a spot.
Sheryl:Now, time to find out if it’s really them.
